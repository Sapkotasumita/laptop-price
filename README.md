# Laptop Price Prediction

A simple Python project to predict laptop prices based on user-defined specifications.

##  Overview

This repository contains a Python script (`Laptop price.py`) that predicts the estimated price of a laptop given its specifications. The project is designed to demonstrate basic price prediction logic using machine learning or rule-based logic (depending on how the script is implemented).

## Features

- Accepts laptop specifications (e.g., brand, RAM, CPU, storage)
- Outputs an estimated price
- Demonstrates basic predictive programming in Python
- Easy to extend with machine learning models

##  Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed (3.7+ recommended).  
Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
